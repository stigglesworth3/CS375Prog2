"I, Kyle Stigler, have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an offical form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my offical university record. I also understand that I will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will recieve a grade of "F" for the course for any additional offense."
